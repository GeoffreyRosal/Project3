Our Project focuses on facial recognition using machine learning. Training of the algorithm would be based on a dataset of celebrity faces. Our project would comprises 3 parts:##

1. Sentiment intepreteation: Facial recognition which categorizes each face based on the emotion shown in the expression in to one of seven categories: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, & neutral. This aspect, would also be done via a real-time feed.
2.	Facial identification: Upon trainig, our algoritihm would be able to recognize images of random celebrities that are inputted.
3.	Facial matching: Upon traing, our algorithm would be able to match non-celebrity images and output their closests celebrity look-alikes.


The end-user would access our work via a website hosted on Heroku.
